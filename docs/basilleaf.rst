Things that worked well
-----------------------

* self guided following tutorials - room for different learning styles / speeds

* hackers paired up - lots of talking-through and figuring things out together

* brightly colored post-its as signal for needing mentor help

* great space, lots of different comfy seating and tables/chairs

* supportive + friendly hackbright community folk in attendance

* lots of mentors with range of different experiences

* I learned a lot being a mentor and new coders rock!


Things that I had questions about
---------------------------------

* among other things I need to learn more about these open source doc tools

* I agree that unit testing would be better as advanced topic

* I haz no idea what is happening with this branching way of doing a pull request in github.. mysteries! 


Room for Improvement 
---------------------

* Django project tutorial is too verbose for a beginners live in-person workshop imo

* more food would be good. ie breakfast, snacks.. maybe local companies would sponsor?
